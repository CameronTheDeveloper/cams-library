# cams-library

This project is a Library app created in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in which you can create a list of books by filling out a form. For each book that you want to add to the list, you can input the title, author, and number of pages. Each book also has a checkbox to keep track of which ones you have read or not read yet. You can remove books from the list or add new ones. My goal for this project is to create an application using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in JavaScript.

Each book is created as an object using a JavaScript constructor and 'new' method.
